#ALTO dialects#
Libraries often need to adapt the ALTO schema. These local formats generally include minor changes to the LoC schema, in order to fulfill specific needs. These differences can be:
 - new attributes 
 - patterns added on attributes 
 - attributes or elements made mandatory 
 - restraints on enumeration
